# 🏠 HOMEPAGE MADE FULLY DYNAMIC

## Overview
The homepage has been converted from hardcoded content to fully dynamic content loaded from the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Controller (app/Controllers/Frontend.php)

**Added:**
- Load `NewsModel` to fetch featured news items
- Get 2 featured news items for homepage
- Pass `featured_news` to view

```php
$newsModel = model('NewsModel');

// Get featured news items
$featuredNews = $newsModel->where('is_featured', 1)
                          ->where('is_active', 1)
                          ->orderBy('published_at', 'DESC')
                          ->limit(2)
                          ->findAll();
```

### 2. Homepage View (app/Views/frontend/pages/home.php)

#### A. Hero Section - Now Dynamic
**Lines 8-20:**
- Hero Title: Loads from `$settings['hero_title']`
- Hero Subtitle: Loads from `$settings['hero_subtitle']`

- Fallback to default text if setting not found

**Lines 30-40:**

#### B. Companies Carousel - Now Dynamic
**Lines 65-100:**

- Loops through `$companies` array from database
- Handles logo URL (uploaded file or external URL)
- Shows company name as text logo if no logo uploaded

### 3. GroceryCRUD Icons Fix

#### A. Configuration (app/Config/GroceryCrudEnterprise.php)
**Lines 87-91:**
Added theme configuration to disable icon libraries:
```php
'theme_config' => [
    'disable_icons' => true,
    'load_third_party_icons' => false,
],
```

#### B. CRUD Layout (app/Views/admin/crud_layout.php)
**Lines 1-10:**
Added filter to skip loading icon CSS files:
```php
<?php foreach($css_files as $file): ?>
	<?php
	// Skip loading icon libraries from GroceryCRUD
	if (strpos($file, 'fontawesome') === false &&
	    strpos($file, 'glyphicons') === false &&
	    strpos($file, 'icons') === false):
	?>
	<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo $file; ?>" />
	<?php endif; ?>
<?php endforeach; ?>
```
