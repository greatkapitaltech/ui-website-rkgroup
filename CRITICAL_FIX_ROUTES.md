# 🔴 CRITICAL FIX - Routes.php Missing!

## The Problem

You reported these pages weren't working:
- ❌ Timeline
- ❌ News & Updates
- ❌ Contact Submissions
- ❌ Site Settings

## Root Cause

**The routes were MISSING in `app/Config/Routes.php`!**

Your sidebar links to:
- `admin/timeline` → NO ROUTE ❌
- `admin/news` → NO ROUTE ❌
- `admin/contacts` → NO ROUTE ❌
- `admin/settings` → NO ROUTE ❌

So CodeIgniter couldn't find the pages (404 errors).

## The Fix

I added the missing routes to `Routes.php` at lines 163-183:

```php
// Timeline Events
$routes->add('timeline', 'Admin::timeline');
$routes->add('timeline/(:any)', 'Admin::timeline/$1');

// News & Updates
$routes->add('news', 'Admin::news');
$routes->add('news/(:any)', 'Admin::news/$1');

// Contact Submissions
$routes->add('contacts', 'Admin::contacts');
$routes->add('contacts/(:any)', 'Admin::contacts/$1');

// Site Settings
$routes->add('settings', 'Admin::settings');
$routes->add('settings/(:any)', 'Admin::settings/$1');
```
