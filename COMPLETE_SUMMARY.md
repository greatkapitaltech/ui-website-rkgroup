## üì§ UPLOAD THESE 6 FILES

## üóÇÔ∏è CREATE UPLOAD DIRECTORIES

After uploading files, create these directories on production:

```bash
mkdir -p assets/uploads/companies
mkdir -p assets/uploads/partners
mkdir -p assets/uploads/board_members
mkdir -p assets/uploads/timeline
chmod 755 assets/uploads/*
```

Or via cPanel File Manager:
- Navigate to `assets/` folder
- Create folder: `uploads`
- Inside `uploads`, create: `companies`, `partners`, `board_members`, `timeline`
- Set all to permissions: **755**

2. Select database: `tempucqs_rkgroup_new_website`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ABOUT PAGE TIMELINE

The `app/Views/frontend/pages/about.php` is currently a placeholder. The Frontend controller already loads timeline data from database. You need to:

**Option 1:** Copy timeline HTML from `_backup_frontend_original/aboutus.html` and update it to loop through `$timeline` variable

**Option 2:** I can create a simple timeline display if you want

The Frontend controller already passes this data:
```php
'timeline' => $timelineModel->where('is_active', 1)->orderBy('year', 'ASC')->findAll()
```

So in `about.php`, you can use:
```php
<?php if (isset($timeline) && !empty($timeline)): ?>
    <?php foreach ($timeline as $event): ?>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <h3><?= esc($event['year']) ?> - <?= esc($event['title']) ?></h3>
            <p><?= esc($event['description']) ?></p>
            <?php if (!empty($event['image_url'])): ?>
                <img src="<?= esc($event['image_url']) ?>">
            <?php endif; ?>
        </div>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
<?php endif; ?>
```

## üêõ COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue: 404 errors on Timeline/News/Contacts/Settings
**Solution:** Upload `Routes.php` - this was the missing fix!

### Issue: Upload directories permission denied
**Solution:**
```bash
chmod 755 assets/uploads
chmod 755 assets/uploads/companies
chmod 755 assets/uploads/partners
chmod 755 assets/uploads/board_members
chmod 755 assets/uploads/timeline
```

### Issue: Sidebar toggle button not visible
**Solution:** Already fixed in header.php with CSS

### Issue: Icons not showing in sidebar
**Solution:** FontAwesome loads from CDN (check internet connection or load admin_assets locally)

### Issue: About page doesn't show timeline
**Solution:** The about.php view needs to be updated with timeline HTML. Current file is just a placeholder.
