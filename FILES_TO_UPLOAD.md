- Line 168-171: Added `admin/news` route

### File 1: Admin.php
**Local Path:** `app/Controllers/Admin.php`
**Production Path:** `app/Controllers/Admin.php`

**Changes:**
- Added `timeline()` method - Full CRUD for timeline_events table
- Added `news()`, `contacts()`, `settings()` method aliases

- Line 1978-2026: New timeline CRUD implementation
- Line 1722-1730: Logo image display callback for partners

### File 2: Frontend.php
**Local Path:** `app/Controllers/Frontend.php`

**Changes:**
- `index()` - Now loads companies, partners, site settings from DB
- `about()` - Loads timeline, board members, advisory members from DB
- `careers()` - Loads site settings from DB
- `connect()` - Loads site settings from DB

### File 3: header.php (Admin Layout)
**Local Path:** `app/Views/admin/layouts/header.php`
**Production Path:** `app/Views/admin/layouts/header.php`

**Changes:**
- Line 43-46: Added Poppins font to all admin elements
- Line 54-56: CSS filter to make logo white (brightness + invert)

### File 4: footer.php (Admin Layout)
**Local Path:** `app/Views/admin/layouts/footer.php`
**Production Path:** `app/Views/admin/layouts/footer.php`

**Changes:**
- Line 5: Changed copyright from "MediSoldier" to "RK Group"

### File 5: login.php (Admin)
**Local Path:** `app/Views/admin/login.php`
**Production Path:** `app/Views/admin/login.php`

**Changes:**
- Line 6: Changed title from "Dreamlane Decor - Admin" to "RK Group - Admin Login"

## üìù SUMMARY: 6 FILES TOTAL

1. ‚úÖ `app/Config/Routes.php` ‚Üê **CRITICAL FIX**
2. ‚úÖ `app/Controllers/Admin.php`
3. ‚úÖ `app/Controllers/Frontend.php`
4. ‚úÖ `app/Views/admin/layouts/header.php`
5. ‚úÖ `app/Views/admin/layouts/footer.php`
6. ‚úÖ `app/Views/admin/login.php`

## üìä ALSO REQUIRED: Run SQL

**File:** `database_schema.sql`
**Action:** Run in production phpMyAdmin on database `tempucqs_rkgroup_new_website`

**What it creates:**
- ‚úÖ companies table (10 sample companies)
- ‚úÖ partners table (10 partners with logos)
- ‚úÖ board_members table (7 board + 3 advisory)
- ‚úÖ contact_submissions table (empty)
- ‚úÖ site_settings table (16 default settings)
- ‚úÖ news_items table (empty)
- ‚úÖ timeline_events table (if not already created)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Safe to run even if some tables exist - uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`

---

## üé® VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Admin Panel Branding:
- **Logo:** Now displays as white on dark header
- **Font:** Poppins applied to entire admin interface
- **Title:** Browser tab shows "RK Group - Admin Panel"
- **Footer:** Copyright shows "¬© 2025 RK Group. All rights reserved."
- **Login Page:** Title "RK Group - Admin Login" with Poppins font

### Partner Logos in Admin:
- Logos now show as **thumbnail images** in the CRUD grid
- Max size: 100px wide x 50px tall
- Shows "No logo" text if logo field is empty
- Supports both:
  - Full URLs (e.g., https://logo.clearbit.com/amazon.com)
  - Filenames (e.g., amazon.png - looks in assets/images/partners/)

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Logo not showing as white
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Fonts not changing to Poppins
**Solution:**
1. Check if Google Fonts loaded (view page source, search for "Poppins")
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check if CSS !important is being overridden

### Issue: Partners page logos not showing
**Solution:**
1. For filenames: Ensure images exist in `public/assets/images/partners/`
2. For URLs: Check if URL is accessible (test in browser)
3. Database `logo` field should contain either full URL or just filename

### Issue: Frontend shows no data
**Solution:**
1. Verify `database_schema.sql` was run successfully
2. Check database has data: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM companies;`
3. Verify all model files exist in `app/Models/`
4. Check error logs: `writable/logs/log-YYYY-MM-DD.log`

### Issue: Timeline/News/Contacts pages 404
**Solution:**
1. Verify `Admin.php` was uploaded successfully
2. Clear CodeIgniter route cache
3. Check .htaccess is properly configured
